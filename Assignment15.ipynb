    "The main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution model: Multiprocessing uses multiple processes, where each process has its own memory space and executes independently, while multithreading uses multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource consumption: Multiprocessing creates multiple processes that consume more system resources, such as memory and CPU time, while multithreading creates multiple threads that share the same resources and consume less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Multiprocessing can achieve true parallelism by utilizing multiple CPU cores, while multithreading achieves concurrency but not necessarily parallelism, as multiple threads may compete for a single CPU core.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication: Communication between processes in multiprocessing is typically done through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes or sockets, while communication between threads in multithreading is done through shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Multiprocessing can scale better as it can utilize multiple CPUs, while multithreading has limitations in scaling due to contention and synchronization issues that arise with large numbers of threads."
